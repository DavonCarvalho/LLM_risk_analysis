# Large Language Model (LLM) Risk Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the "LLM Risk Navigator" project by Team Patriots. Our goal is to develop an industry-specific risk matrix that helps organizations to prioritize mitigation efforts for LLM integration. This matrix is designed to empower businesses to navigate the complexities of LLM integration with confidence and resilience.

## Project Goals

Security Assessments: To accompany the rising integration of LLMs into business systems with robust security assessments.
Mitigation Strategies: Development of tailored risk assessment methodologies to proactively address security concerns.
Industry-Specific Solutions: Innovating solutions that are tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of various industries.
Structure

##  The repository is structured as follows:

/data: This directory contains datasets used for analysis, including industry-specific data and LLM attack vectors.
/docs: Documentation related to project findings, including risk assessments and methodology descriptions.
/src: Source code for the analysis scripts and tools developed during the project.
Key Components

Threat Identification: Analysis of known attack vectors against LLMs.
Vulnerability Assessment: Using tools like Markov Chain analysis to predict potential attack paths and vulnerabilities.
Consequence Analysis: Evaluating the potential impacts of successful attacks on different sectors.
Technologies Used

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
R: For statistical analysis and visualization.
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize risks.
